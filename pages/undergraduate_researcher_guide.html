            <h3 id="my-background">My Background</h3>
            <p>I am a computer science and math major at a STEM-focused small liberal arts college, where is I have done most of my research. I have also done research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, but I will be focusing this discussion on the research I have done in academia. My areas of research are machine learning, human-computer interaction, and computer science education. I provide this background because what worked for me in my context may not work for other contexts, (namely, research at a large research institution is very different from a liberal arts college) but I hope some of these insights can be generally useful.</p>
            <h3 id="why-i-wrote-this-guide">Why I wrote this guide</h3>
            <p>I wrote this guide because I wanted to share some things I wish I knew when I started research, both in terms of general advice and in terms of specific resources.</p>

            <h2 id="why-be-an-undergrad-researcher">Why be an undergraduate student researcher?</h2>
            <p>Before I started, here were some reasons why I wanted to pursue undergraduate research. I wanted to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>create new knowledge.</li>
                <li>connect with professors.</li>
                <li>learn outside of the classroom.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After having done research for over two years now, here are some reasons why I am glad I did research as an undergraduate, in order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Working in a team taught me how to communicate with others.</li>
                <li>I met and became friends with people I would never have talked to.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed the freedom to learn beyond the confines a classroom.</li>
                <li>I learned about topics that I never would have even heard about otherwise.</li>
                <li>I practiced and honed technical skills, such as software development and academic writing.</li>
                <li>I would like to go to graduate school and doing undergraduate research looks good on your application (I try not to live my life in pursuit of external determinations of my value, but this is the unfortunate reality we live in so it is important to mention nonetheless).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 id="you-are-not-a-failure">You are not a failure</h2>
            <p>The most important thing I can tell to anyone doing undergraduate research is <b>you are not a failure</b>. Full stop. Your value is not determined by your research. This is the single most important takeaway from undergraduate research, or any experience in life, really. I know what it's like to feel like a failure, and how hard it is to internalize other people's encouragement. Also, failure isn't as eagerly shared as success, so it is easy to feel that you are failing alone.</p>

            <p>I know if I were reading guide, it would not be enough for me to just hear "you are not a failure." So in addition, I will describe the details of my failure, how I felt, and how I think about that time looking back. I hope this resonates with some of you. If you're looking for more practical advice, such as how to read papers, feel free to skip this section.</p>

            <h3 id="two-years">Two years of failure</h3>
            <p>The summer after my freshman year, just a few days after finals had ended, I had arrived at the computer science building with high hopes and excitement for what the summer might bring me. After being interested in machine learning for all of high school and writing about research in all of my college applications, now was finally my opportunity to become a <em>real machine learning research</em>. Little did I know, I would embark on a two-year long nightmare involving an immense amount of crying, anxiety, and the slow but sure crumbling of my self-esteem. This is all normal to some extent, but the magnitude to which I was experiencing this was not. My project was going so poorly and I was so stressed out that I would cry frequently in my room, in professor's offices, in the lab room, when I was walking places, and most embarassingly, in public places. This was the worst because I didn't want to make a scene but thoughts of my failed research had consumed my life so much that I could not stop the tears from coming. I cried a few times in student work areas and I once even cried during my PE class and the instructor asked me to leave because I was too upset to participate. Not having results, after over a year, made me so anxious that at any mention of research, not even my own research but <em>any</em> mention of research, I would get heart palpitations, feel a lump in my throat, and feel a tightness in my chest.</p>

            <p>Over the course of the project, I watched six different teammates join and leave the project at various points for various reasons, ending up with me as the sole student. The original project we were given was extremely challenging, so we kept jumping back and forth between theory and application, and ended up with 5 iterations of the project, four Overleaf projects, and three GitHub repositories, all iterations completely different from the last. I experienced teammate conflicts and I even experienced advisor conflicts. I would compare myself to others constantly: one group in the lab published <em>three papers</em> in <em>one summer</em>, and here I was with 0 publications in two years. One of my friends had a publication after working a little bit during the semseter, meanwhile I had done a summer of full-time research and over 300 hours across four semesters and still had nothing. I had many negative thoughts, like</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I should give up."</li>
                <li>"I'm not smart enough."</li>
                <li>"I'm not cut out to be a researcher."</li>
                <li>"I'm a failure, X student has already published/won awards and I have nothing."</li>
                <li>"I'll never get into grad school."</li>
                <li>"What's the point of doing this? No one cares."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="addressing-doubts">Addressing my doubts</h3>
            <h4 id="give-up">"I should give up."</h4>
            <p>Whatever you are doing, make sure there is a good reason. If you are going to keep going, make sure you have a good reason to so you don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. If you are going to give up, make sure you have good reason to so you don't give up prematurely. But also, I would say IT IS OKAY TO GIVE UP. Even though continuing and giving up both have their pros and cons, giving up is far more discouraged. Definitely don't give up without a good reason, but remember that giving up does not reflect your value as a person or your capability as scientist. Also consider that giving up on your project makes space in your life: it may be for a newer, more exciting project, but it also may be for friends or hobbies which are important as well. I spent so much time on this project that I was sometimes in the lab until 9 PM or even 11 PM, sacrificing quality time with my friends. No matter what you do you are always giving up something, so consider if you would rather give up research or some other aspect of your life.</p>

            <h4 id="smart-enough">"I'm not smart enough."</h4>
            <p>Research output has no bearing on how smart you are. Failures happen all the time, they just aren't broadcast as loudly as successes. Learning how to conduct research is a skill, so it makes sense that as an undergraduate, these skills aren't honed yet. You are still learning, so it is okay if you are going slow and don't have everything right away, it's all part of the learning process. Also, I will briefly mention that academic intelligence is not the only type of intelligence nor the most important one.</p>

            <h4 id="cut-out">"I'm not cut out to be a researcher."</h4>
            <p>I would have a similar response as above. PhD programs are all about training people to be researchers, so as an undergrad, it makes sense that you are struggling. Your failures as an undergrad do not indicate that you are not suited for a research career, if anything, the ability to bounce back from those failures indicates that you are resilient, which is not only an important characteristic to have for research, but also an important characteristic to have for the rest of your life.</p>

            <h4 id="x-student">"I'm a failure, X student has already published/won awards and I have nothing."</h4>
            <p>I felt like this for a long time until one of my professors pointed out to me that my situation and other students' situations were not at all comparable. I was working by myself, they had teams. I was trying to do a theory project, they were doing software development. Projects differ so much in terms of topic, scope, expectations, and teams, and people differ so much in terms of socioeconomic background, experience, and career goals, that you really cannot compare two projects or two students, because they really are completely different.</p>

            <h4 id="grad-school">"I'll never get into grad school."</h4>
            <p>Publications help but are not required for grad school. I was told this multiple times and that still did not ease my anxiety. Related to the previous doubt, it is also difficult not to compare yourself with others when that is precisely what grad school admissions does. I've made peace with grad school admissions with the mindset that "I will put forth my best self, with or without publications, and the school can take it or leave it." After living my entire life trying to prove my worth to other people, parents, teachers, admissions officers, companies, I just got sick of it. I have learned to accept what is out of my control and to understand when it's not about me. This peace of mind has taken me years to achieve after a lifetime of anxiety and cannot be succinctly described in a blog post, but it is honestly how I deal with the possibility of rejection.</p>
